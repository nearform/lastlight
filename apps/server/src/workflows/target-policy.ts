 * warm `node_modules` + an incremental `git fetch` instead of a fresh
 * 1.3G clone + full install each time, and N dirs/PR collapse to 1 (issue
 * #107, cutting the #106 churn at its source). Concurrency is held off by
 * the dispatcher's `isRunning(skill, triggerId)` guard plus
 * `runs.getByTrigger` reuse — two runs never share the dir live; the
 * cross-run refresh in `prePopulateWorkspace` resets it cleanly between them.
 * `build` is handled by `PER_TARGET_RECREATE_WORKFLOWS` instead — it must not
 * *refresh* a stale checkout (that would reset onto the old feature branch);
 * it recreates the workspace from the default branch.
